Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project demonstrates stock price prediction using historical data from the Indian market. The model is built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a deep learning technique for time series data. It is developed in a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab, and various charts and graphs are used to visualize the accuracy of predictions.

Features

	•	Stock Data: Includes Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume fields.
	•	LSTM Model: Designed to forecast future stock prices based on past data.
	•	Data Visualization: Graphs show trends and prediction accuracy for easy interpretation.
	•	Testing on Unseen Data: The model is validated using a new dataset obtained from Kaggle.

Key Steps

	1.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Handled missing data and normalized the stock prices.
	2.	Model Implementation:
	•	Built an LSTM model for forecasting.
	•	Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
	3.	Training:
	•	Trained the model using historical stock prices.
	4.	Visualization:
	•	Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create charts.
	5.	Testing on Unseen Data:
	•	Validated the model on new data to check its performance.

Installation and Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

	1.	Clone the repository:
		git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git

	2.	Navigate to the project directory:
		cd stock-price-prediction

	3.	Install the required dependencies:
		pip install -r requirements.txt

	4.	Open the Jupyter notebook (Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb) in Google Colab or your local environment.

Dependencies: 

	You can install these by running:
		pip install -r requirements.txt

Visualization

Here are a few visualizations included in the notebook:

	•	Stock Price Trends: Line chart showing the actual vs predicted stock prices.
	•	Training Loss: Plot showing the model’s loss over time during training.
	•	Predictions: Graph comparing real stock prices with model predictions on unseen data.

Results

	•	The LSTM model achieved an RMSE of X.XX on the test dataset.
	•	The model successfully predicted future stock prices with good accuracy, as shown by the plots in the notebook.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how LSTM can be effectively used for time series forecasting, particularly for stock price prediction. The use of visualizations helps to interpret the results and validate the model’s performance.
