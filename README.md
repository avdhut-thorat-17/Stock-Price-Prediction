Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project aims to predict future stock prices based on historical data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. It focuses on the Indian stock market and leverages time series data for accurate predictions. The project is built and demonstrated using Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab and includes comprehensive visualizations for a better understanding of the predictions.

Features

	•	Stock Data: Historical stock data from the Indian market (2000-2020), including fields such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume.
	•	LSTM Model: A robust deep learning model designed for time series forecasting.
	•	Data Visualization: Charts and graphs that illustrate trends, patterns, and prediction accuracy.
	•	Evaluation Metrics: Performance of the model is evaluated using common metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
	•	Unseen Data Testing: The model is tested on an unseen dataset obtained from Kaggle to evaluate its real-world performance.

Project Structure

	•	Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb: The Jupyter Notebook file containing all the code, data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.
	•	/data: The folder contains the stock market dataset (can be imported via Google Colab if using a remote dataset).
	•	README.md: The file you are currently reading.

Key Steps

	1.	Data Preprocessing:
	•	Loaded stock data and handled missing values.
	•	Normalized the data for optimal performance.
	2.	Model Implementation:
	•	Built an LSTM model for time series forecasting.
	•	Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
	3.	Training:
	•	Trained the model on historical stock data.
	4.	Visualization:
	•	Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot various trends such as stock prices over time, predicted vs actual values, and training loss curves.
	5.	Testing on Unseen Data:
	•	After training, the model was tested on an unseen dataset to validate its predictive power.

Installation and Setup

	1.	Clone the repository:
       git clone https://github.com/avdhut-thorat-17/Stock-Price-Prediction.git
	2.	Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab or your local environment.
 	3.	Install the necessary dependencies:
       pip install -r requirements.txt
	4.	Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and visualize predictions.


 Dependencies

	•	Python 3.x
	•	Pandas
	•	NumPy
	•	Matplotlib
	•	Seaborn
	•	TensorFlow/Keras
	•	Scikit-learn


 You can install the required libraries by running:
        pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn tensorflow scikit-learn

Visualization

Here are a few examples of the visualizations generated by the model:

	•	Stock Price Trends: A line graph showing the actual vs predicted stock prices over time.
	•	Training Loss Curve: A graph representing the loss during model training to ensure convergence.
	•	Prediction Accuracy: A visual comparison between the true stock prices and predicted prices.

How to Use

	1.	Use the notebook to train the model on your own dataset or the provided dataset.
	2.	Modify the parameters, such as the number of LSTM layers, epochs, and batch size, to improve the model’s accuracy.
	3.	Visualize the results using the built-in plotting functions.

Results

	•	Achieved an RMSE of X.XX on the test dataset.
	•	Demonstrated good accuracy in predicting the closing stock prices on unseen data.

Conclusion

This project shows the effectiveness of using LSTM for time series forecasting, particularly in predicting stock prices. The combination of proper data preprocessing, model tuning, and visualization helps to better understand market trends and model performance.
